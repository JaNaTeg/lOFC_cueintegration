# lOFC_cueintegration

This repository contains data and scripts related to our publication "Lateral orbitofrontal cortex integrates predictive information across multiple cues to guide behavior" by Tegelbeckers, Porter, Voss, Schoenbaum and Kahnt in Current Biology

behavioral data of two studies include:
  - response times and accuracies of task expectations during conditioning and compound conditioning
  - all analyses used in the publication

fMRI data includes:
- extracted data and analyses of parameter estimates of univariate contrast for compound > single cues
- data and script to run decoding of reward representations in lOFC and mOFC
- data and script to run decoding of differences in reward representations in lOFC and mOFC between compound and single cues
